# Memory and Awareness

## Memory
Agent stores and retrieves conversations, actions, and observations across various timescales. This allows them to learn from experience, maintain context, and make more informed decisions.

## Action Awareness
Enables agents to assess their own state and performance, allowing for moment-by-moment adjustments.  This self-awareness allows agents to make moment-by-moment adjustments, correct errors, and optimize their behavior.
