# Agent Architectures

## Agent Architecture
A blueprint defining the internal components of an agent, including data structures, operations, and control flow.

## Reactive Architectures
Simple control systems that react directly to the environment.

## Deliberative Architectures
Complex systems that use symbolic representations, models, and planning based on mental attitudes like goals.

## Hybrid Architectures
Combine reactive and deliberative elements for fast responses and long-term planning.
