# Agent Architectures

## Agent Architecture
A blueprint defining the internal components of an agent, including data structures, operations, and control flow. The architecture determines how the agent perceives, reasons, and acts.

## Reactive Architectures
Simple control systems that react directly to the environment. These agents react quickly to the environment but lack internal models or planning capabilities.

## Deliberative Architectures
Complex systems that use symbolic representations, models, and planning based on mental attitudes like goals. These agents reason about their goals and the environment to make informed decisions.

## Hybrid Architectures
Combine reactive and deliberative elements for fast responses and long-term planning. This allows agents to react quickly to immediate situations while also engaging in long-term planning and reasoning.
