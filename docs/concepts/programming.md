# Programming

## Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)
A programming paradigm centred around the concept of agents with beliefs, commitments, and capabilities. It provides a framework for designing and implementing complex agent systems. AOP specializes object-oriented programming by fixing the state of modules (agents) to include mental components and by using communication primitives based on speech acts like informing, requesting, and offering.

## Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Model
A model of agency where agents' behaviour is driven by their beliefs, desires, and intentions. This model provides a basis for reasoning about goals, plans, and actions.

## Commitment Rules 
Rules that guide an agent's commitments based on message conditions, mental conditions, and actions. These rules determine how an agent responds to communication and how it commits to future actions.

## Fact Statements
Fundamental statements used to specify the content of actions and conditions for their execution. These statements form the basis for reasoning about actions and their effects.
