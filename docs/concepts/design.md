# Agent Design Principles

## Solvability
Each sub-task should be independently and completely resolvable by at least one agent. This ensures that the system can effectively address all aspects of the problem.

## Completeness
Ensuring that all necessary information is included in the task decomposition. This prevents critical aspects from being overlooked.

## Non-Redundancy
Avoiding unnecessary or duplicate content in sub-tasks. This reduces inefficiency and ensures that agents are not performing the same work.
