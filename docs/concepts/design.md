# Design Principles

## Solvability
Each sub-task should be independently and completely resolvable by at least one agent. This ensures that the system can effectively address all aspects of the problem.

## Completeness
Ensuring that all necessary information is included in the task decomposition. This prevents critical aspects from being overlooked.

## Non-Redundancy
Avoiding unnecessary or duplicate content in sub-tasks. This reduces inefficiency and ensures that agents are not performing the same work.

## Memory
Agent stores and retrieves conversations, actions, and observations across various timescales. This allows them to learn from experience, maintain context, and make more informed decisions.

## Action Awareness
Enables agents to assess their own state and performance, allowing for moment-by-moment adjustments.  This self-awareness allows agents to make moment-by-moment adjustments, correct errors, and optimize their behavior.
