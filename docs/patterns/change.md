# Change Management Patterns
By focusing on these patterns, organizations can leverage organizational behaviour best practices to navigate the complexities of human-AI interaction and manage the adoption of agentic AI in a way that maximizes benefits and fosters a positive and productive working environment.

## Cultivating Trust and Ensuring Reliability
Building trust in AI agents is crucial for their integration into organizational workflows. This requires ensuring the agents are reliable, predictable, and that their limitations are clearly communicated to users. Implementing robust error handling, automatic retries, and monitoring mechanisms can enhance reliability. Addressing ethical and social concerns related to AI adoption is also vital for building trust and legitimacy.

## Establishing Clear and Defined Objectives
Clearly defining the purpose, capabilities, and limitations of AI agents is fundamental for successful adoption. This includes ensuring that agents communicate their reasoning, intentions, and actions in a way that is understandable to human users. A well-defined task or persona is essential for agents to operate effectively. Organizations should also clearly articulate the goals, constraints, and expected outcomes for each agent. Furthermore, when designing agents, adopting language resembling human "speech acts" can improve interaction.

## Implementing Feedback Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement
Establishing feedback loops allows for the continuous evaluation and refinement of AI agents, which is crucial for both improving their performance and fostering user acceptance. Continuous evaluation and incorporating feedback loops based on real-world scenarios are best practices for identifying areas of improvement. This aligns with the organization behaviour principle that feedback is essential for individual and organizational learning.

## Leveraging Reinforcement and Encouragement
Drawing from organizational behaviour principles of reinforcement, positive reinforcement and feedback mechanisms can be used to encourage employees to explore and effectively integrate agentic AI into their work. Recognizing and rewarding the successful adoption and utilization of AI agents can further facilitate this process.

## Prioritizing User-Centric Design and Seamless Integration
Focusing on the needs and preferences of the end-users is essential for the successful adoption of agentic AI. Designing user interfaces that are intuitive and align with users' mental models of the AI agents' capabilities will improve user experience. User interface design should be more of an individual affair driven by personalized intelligence. Providing Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support at appropriate intervention points is also critical for maintaining user control and trust.
