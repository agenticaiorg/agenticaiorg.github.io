# Product Design Patterns
Agentic AI offers powerful new possibilities for product innovation and adaptation but also requires careful consideration of ethical, social, and practical implementation challenges

## Adaptive and Evolving Designs
AI agents exhibiting autonomous learning and refining models based on feedback demonstrate evolutionary behaviour, suggesting product designs can be inherently adaptive and evolve over time.

## Consideration of Ethical and Social Impacts
The product roadmap must account for the ethical and social impacts of increasingly autonomous AI, including the need for explainability and trustworthiness. This includes focusing on human-centered AI.

## Customization and Personalization
AI agents can learn individual user preferences and adapt their features accordingly, leading to personalized experiences.

## Identifying Future Product Directions 
Automated design can help envision and roadmap entirely new product concepts and features based on automatically discovered AI architectures.

## Product Design
Automated Generation of Novel Designs: Approaches like Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS) aim to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, potentially leading to novel building blocks and combinations for AI-powered products.

## Regulatory Considerations 
Product development will need to consider evolving regulatory and compliance requirements for autonomous AI systems.

## Self-Learning and Improvement of Features
Products with self-learning agents can have features that continuously improve and adapt based on user behaviour and environmental feedback.

## Testing and Evaluation
New metrics for evaluating performance, reliability, and trustworthiness of agentic AI systems will be crucial. This includes ensuring alignment with human values. Metrics like task completion rate and tool selection accuracy become important.
