# User Perspectives

Agentic AI fundamentally changes how users interact with software and systems, introducing new dynamics and considerations:

## Evolving Interaction Paradigms
Users will likely move beyond just clicking menus. Imagine talking or typing requests more naturally, getting helpful suggestions before you even ask, and working with the software like a partner on tasks. Good design will aim to make this feel easy and keep you in the driver's seat.

## Building Trust and Managing Autonomy
A big change in user's mindset will be learning to trust AI agents that can act on their own. Users will want to understand what they can (and can't) do and why they make certain decisions. Good systems will let you easily see what the agent is doing, guide it, and step in to take over if needed.

## Adapting to Learning and Dynamic Systems
Users will interact with systems that continuously learn and adapt based on their behavior and data. This requires users to be aware that the system may change over time and understand how their interactions contribute to the agent's learning process. Providing clear feedback loops for users to correct or guide agent behavior is essential.

## Reskilling and Collaboration with Agents
In many jobs, users might find themselves teaming up with AI agents. This means learning how to best work together â€“ letting the AI handle routine stuff so you can focus on bigger picture thinking, creative tasks, or complex problems that need a human touch.

## Understanding and Navigating Ethical Implications
Users will become more aware of the ethical dimensions of AI, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency. Designing systems that are transparent about data usage, explainable in their decisions, and provide users with control over their data and interactions is vital for user acceptance and ethical use.

## Personalized and Proactive Experiences
Agentic AI enables highly personalized and proactive user experiences. Agents can anticipate user needs, offer tailored recommendations, and automate tasks based on individual preferences and context, leading to more efficient and satisfying interactions, provided privacy and control are maintained.
