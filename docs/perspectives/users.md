# User Perspectives

Agentic AI fundamentally changes how users interact with software and systems, introducing new dynamics and considerations:

## Evolving Interaction Paradigms
Users will move beyond traditional graphical user interfaces to engage with systems through more natural language, proactive suggestions, and collaborative workflows with agents. This requires designing intuitive and adaptable interaction models that manage complexity and maintain user agency.

## Building Trust and Managing Autonomy
A key challenge is establishing user trust in autonomous agents. Users need to understand the agent's capabilities, limitations, and the rationale behind its actions. Designing mechanisms for users to oversee, guide, and, when necessary, override agent decisions is crucial for managing the perceived level of autonomy.

## Adapting to Learning and Dynamic Systems
Users will interact with systems that continuously learn and adapt based on their behavior and data. This requires users to be aware that the system may change over time and understand how their interactions contribute to the agent's learning process. Providing clear feedback loops for users to correct or guide agent behavior is essential.

## Reskilling and Collaboration with Agents
In professional contexts, users will increasingly work alongside AI agents. This necessitates a focus on reskilling and upskilling the workforce to effectively collaborate with agents, leveraging their capabilities while focusing on higher-level, strategic, and creative tasks that require human intelligence.

## Understanding and Navigating Ethical Implications
Users will become more aware of the ethical dimensions of AI, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency. Designing systems that are transparent about data usage, explainable in their decisions, and provide users with control over their data and interactions is vital for user acceptance and ethical use.

## Personalized and Proactive Experiences
Agentic AI enables highly personalized and proactive user experiences. Agents can anticipate user needs, offer tailored recommendations, and automate tasks based on individual preferences and context, leading to more efficient and satisfying interactions, provided privacy and control are maintained.
