# Product Perspectives

From a software product management perspective, Agentic AI introduces significant shifts and requires changes in several key areas:

## Redefining Product Scope and Capabilities
It's not just about adding buttons. We need to imagine how these agents can work on their own, offer help before being asked, and interact with users in totally new ways. We have to decide how much freedom the agents have and where they fit in the product.

## Evolving User Experience Design
User experience changes. Instead of just clicking through static screens, users will interact with agents that learn and adapt. We need to design these interactions so they feel natural, build trust, and make it clear how to work with the agent (and what to do if it makes mistakes).

## Data Strategy and Management
Smart agents need lots of data to learn and work well. Product managers must have a clear plan for gathering data, keeping it private and secure, and using it ethically. Managing this data properly is key to making the product work well and keeping users' trust.

## Continuous Learning and Improvement Loops
These products aren't finished at launch â€“ they keep learning. We need systems to watch how the agents are performing, get feedback from users, and continuously update the agents so they get smarter and more helpful over time.

## Measuring Success and Defining Metrics
Conventional ways of measuring product success might not be enough. We need new metrics. How well is the agent doing its job? Do people trust it? Is it actually making things easier or faster for users? What's the real impact?

## Ethical Product Development and Governance
Product managers are key in making sure AI is built responsibly. That means watching out for bias in how agents behave, being open about how they work, and making sure we follow the rules and regulations for AI.

## Collaboration with AI/ML Teams
To build these products well, product managers need to work very closely with the AI and machine learning teams. Understanding what the agents can realistically do (and its limits) is crucial for making smart product decisions.
