# Product Perspectives

From a software product management perspective, Agentic AI introduces significant shifts and requires changes in several key areas:

## Redefining Product Scope and Capabilities
Product managers must think beyond traditional feature sets and consider how autonomous agents can extend product capabilities, offer proactive value, and interact with users in novel ways. This involves defining the scope of agent autonomy and their integration points within the product ecosystem.

## Evolving User Experience Design
Designing for agentic products requires a shift from static interfaces to dynamic, context-aware interactions. Product managers need to focus on designing intuitive ways for users to understand, trust, and collaborate with agents, managing expectations around agent behavior and potential errors.

## Data Strategy and Management
Agentic AI heavily relies on data for learning and operation. Product managers must define robust data strategies, including data collection, privacy, security, and ethical use. Managing the lifecycle of data used by agents becomes critical for product performance and user trust.

## Continuous Learning and Improvement Loops
Agentic products are not static; they learn and evolve. Product managers need to establish processes for monitoring agent performance, gathering feedback, and implementing continuous learning and improvement loops to enhance agent effectiveness and adapt to changing user needs and environments.

## Measuring Success and Defining Metrics
Traditional product metrics may not fully capture the value and impact of agentic features. Product managers must define new metrics that account for agent performance, user trust in agents, the efficiency gains provided by agents, and the overall impact on user outcomes.

## Ethical Product Development and Governance
Product managers are on the front lines of ensuring ethical considerations are embedded in the product lifecycle. This includes addressing potential biases in agent behavior, ensuring transparency in how agents operate, and navigating regulatory landscapes related to AI and autonomous systems.

## Collaboration with AI/ML Teams
Effective product management for agentic AI requires closer collaboration with AI/ML research and engineering teams. Product managers need to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI technologies to define feasible and impactful product strategies.
